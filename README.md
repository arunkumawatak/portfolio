# Arun's Personal Portfolio Website
![Alt text](assets/prScreenShot/prSs.png)


A clean, modern, and fully responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills and projects as a Flutter App Developer. The design is inspired by elegant, minimalist principles and is built from the ground up with pure HTML, CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Fully Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to widescreen desktop monitors.
-   **Two-Page Layout:**
    -   A main **landing page** (`index.html`) with a hero section, "About Me," featured projects, and a contact form.
    -   A dedicated **"All Projects" page** (`project.html`) with a beautiful grid layout for showcasing my entire body of work.
-   **Interactive Project Cards:**
    -   Elegant project cards with a clean separation of the logo and content.
    -   A unique "click-to-reveal" feature that transforms a "See Project" icon into animated, direct links to the Play Store and App Store.
-   **Dynamic Theming:** Card backgrounds and interactive elements use a predefined, soft color palette that can be easily customized. The store link icons automatically inherit an accent color from their parent card for a cohesive look.
-   **Clean Navigation:** A theme-matching "Back to Home" button on the projects page ensures a smooth user experience.
-   **Built with Web Standards:** No frameworks, just semantic HTML5, modern CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Custom Properties), and lightweight JavaScript for interactivity.
